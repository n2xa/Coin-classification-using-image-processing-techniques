# Coin-classification-using-image-processing-techniques
This MATLAB code performs coin analysis through image processing techniques. Initially, the image undergoes binary conversion for clear coin separation and hole filling to ensure singular coin structures. Labeling and property extraction capture essential data like coin areas and bounding boxes. Visualization includes a labeled image showcasing uniquely identified coins. The code distinguishes between nickels and dimes by comparing coin areas, delineating each type on the original image using color-coded text and rectangles. Finally, it provides a summary detailing the total coin count alongside separate tallies for nickels and dimes, offering a comprehensive analysis of the coin distribution within the image.
